# Titanic Classification

The following Python code was constructed to learn and practice the use Classification Machine Learning algorithms, more specifically K-Means Clustering. The dataset used for this projects was the Titanic dataset. The goal was to accurately predict the survival rates. The K-Means algorithm orginally performed poorly, but to overcome this problem and improve accuracy, the values were scaled and a pipeline was made to transform features for better clustering.
